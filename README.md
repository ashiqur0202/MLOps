## Version Control for Machine Learning

### Introduction to Version Control
Version control is a crucial aspect of managing machine learning (ML) projects. It allows teams to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a history of project development. In the context of ML, version control becomes essential for tracking both code and data changes.

### Git Basics
Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development and increasingly in ML. Key Git concepts include repositories, commits, branches, and merges. Understanding these basics is essential for effective version control in ML projects.

### Git Branching Strategies for ML Projects
ML projects often involve experimentation and the exploration of different models or approaches. Git branching strategies, such as feature branches or Gitflow, help organize these experiments, making it easier to manage parallel developments, isolate changes, and merge updates seamlessly.

### Handling Data and Model Files with Git LFS
Large files, such as datasets and trained models, are common in ML projects. Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension to Git that manages large files efficiently. This section covers the integration of Git LFS into ML workflows, ensuring smooth handling of large files in version control.

### Automated Model Deployment Pipelines
Automated model deployment pipelines automate the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model into production. This involves packaging the model, deploying it to a serving environment, and making it available for inference.

### Components of Automated Model Deployment Pipeline
1. **Model Packaging:** Creating a deployable artifact from the trained model, often using containerization (e.g., Docker).
2. **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Setting up the necessary infrastructure for hosting the model, which may include cloud services or on-premises servers.
3. **Deployment to Production:** Automating the deployment of the model to the target environment.

### Rollback Strategies and Versioning in CD
Rollback strategies are crucial in CD for ML to handle situations where a newly deployed model introduces issues or performance degradation. Versioning becomes essential to keep track of different iterations of models.

### Rollback Strategies
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Having two environments, blue for the current version and green for the new version. Switching traffic to the green environment if it passes tests, and rolling back by switching back to blue if issues arise.
- **Canary Deployment:** Gradual rollout to a subset of users, monitoring for issues. If problems arise, rollback is performed for that specific subset.

### Model Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning:** Assigning versions based on major, minor, and patch changes to signify backward compatibility.
- **Model Registry:** Maintaining a registry of deployed models, including metadata and performance metrics.
